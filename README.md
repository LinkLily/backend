# LinkLily Backend

LinkLily's backend, using Actix and MongoDB. 

At the moment, a lot of the code here is adapted from
[this article](https://dev.to/hackmamba/build-a-rest-api-with-rust-and-mongodb-actix-web-version-ei1)
and
[this article](https://medium.com/intelliconnect-engineering/securing-apis-with-apikey-39d0e22f62dd)
while I learn more about Actix, authentication, and Rust itself.
